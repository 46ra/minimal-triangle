## about
*minimal triangle* is a minimalistic and experimental font which is created under restrictions: for any letter 𝑙 of Latin alphabet,

- the number of edges (resp. vertices) of 𝑙 must be as fewer as possible
- for any edge 𝑒 of 𝑙, 𝑒 must be inside of a right bottom isosceles right triangle
- for any vertex 𝑣 of the triangle, for some edge 𝑒, 𝑒 must touch 𝑣.

The font has no destinction between uppercase and lowercase and therefore it has only 26 letters.

# example

the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog
