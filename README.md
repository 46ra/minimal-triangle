# minimal triangle

## about
*minimal triangle* is a minimal and experimental font which is created under restrictions for any letter l,
- the number of edges of l must be as less as possible
- the number of vertices of l must be as less as possible
- for any edge e of l, e must be inside of a right bottom isosceles right triangle
- for any vertex v of the triangle, for some edge e, e must touch v.
