# minimal triangle

![preview](/images/preview.png)

## about
*minimal triangle* is a minimalistic and experimental font which is created under restrictions: for any letter l of Latin alphabet,

- the number of edges of l must be as less as possible
- the number of vertices of l must be as less as possible
- for any edge e of l, e must be inside of a right bottom isosceles right triangle
- for any vertex v of the triangle, for some edge e, e must touch v

with 'F' being an exception.

The font has no destinction between uppercase and lowercase and therefore it has only 26 letters.
